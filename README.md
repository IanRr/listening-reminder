# GMU MONDAY REMINDER EXTENSION

this is a Chrome extension to help anyone who wants to remember to just listen

It's maybe a little clumsy but also whatever?  To paraphrase R. Beef Kazenzakis, "It's not like even know if you care." ...

It doesn't stop you from posting, of course, it just reminds you when it's Monday UTC

It looks like this:
