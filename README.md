# GMU MONDAY REMINDER EXTENSION

This is a Chrome extension to help anyone who wants to remember to just listen.

**Heads up though!  It won't affect your phone's Facebook app.  I don't know how to do that yet or possibly ever**

It's maybe a little clumsy but also whatever?  To paraphrase R. Beef Kazenzakis, "It's not like even know if you care." ... If you do, there's a few things I'd like to do to expand it, like for example make it work with other groups besides [God Messed Up And Here We Are](https://www.facebook.com/groups/862008810509325)

It doesn't stop you from posting, of course, it just reminds you when it's Monday UTC by adding a little CSS to the page.

It looks like this:

## Installation

It's pretty easy. I don't have a Windows machine so I've only tried this on Mac, but it should be pretty much the same.

Near the top of this screen, click the "clone or download" button and "download ZIP"

![Download The ZIP](https://github.com/IanRr/listening-reminder/blob/master/img/download-zip.png)

and then choose **Extensions** from the **Windows** menu, or go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) ... you may need to enable "Developer Mode" if it isn't, otherwise nothing will happen

![Setting Developer Mode](https://github.com/IanRr/listening-reminder/blob/master/img/developer-mode.png "Setting Developer Mode")

Just dropped the (unzipped) folder you downloaded onto the screen, and you should see it appear in your extensions!

And that is it!  Every week, starting on Monday 12AM UTC, you'll get extra help remembering to, y'know, sit down

**Good luck!! Happy listening!!**
